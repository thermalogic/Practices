    "One of the earliest estimates, $4*(8/9)2 = 3.16$, can found in the **Egyptian Rhind Papyrus**, circa 1650 BC. More than a thousand years later, the **Old Testament** implied a different value for $π$ when giving the specifications of one of King Solomon’s\n",

    "**Archimedes of Syracuse** (287-212 BCE) derived upper and lower bounds on the value of $π$ by using a high-degree polygon to approximate a circular shape. Using a polygon with 96 sides, he concluded that $223/71 < π < 22/7$. Giving upper and lower bounds was a rather sophisticated approach for the time. Also, if we take his best estimate as the average of his two bounds we obtain $3.1418$, an error of about $0.0002$. **Not bad!**\n",

    "Long before computers were invented, the French mathematicians **Buffon** (1707-1788) and **Laplace** (1749-1827) proposed using a stochastic simulation to estimate the value of $π$. Think about inscribing a circle in a square with sides of length $2$, so that the radius, $r$, of the circle is of length $1$.\n",

Buffon suggested that he could estimate the area of a circle by a dropping a large number of needles (which he argued would follow a random path as they fell) in the vicinity of the square. The ratio of the number of needles with tips lying within the square to the number of needles with tips lying within the circle could then be used to estimate the area of the circle.\n",

It then uses the` Pythagorean theorem` to compute the hypotenuse of the right triangle with base $x$ and height $y$. This is the distance of the tip of the needle from the origin (the center of the square). Since the radius of the circle is $1$, we know that the needle lies within the circle if and only if the distance from the origin is no greater than $1$. We use this fact to count the number of needles in the circle.\n",
