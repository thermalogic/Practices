   * EXAMPLE 8.5 ：A Regenerative Cycle with Open Feedwater Heater,Page 456

Consider a regenerative vapor power cycle with one open feedwater heater.

* Steam enters the turbine at 8.0 MPa, 480°C and expands to 0.7 MPa, 

* Some of the steam is extracted and diverted to the open feedwater heater operating at 0.7 MPa. 

* The remaining steam expands through the second-stage turbine to the condenser pressure of 0.008 MPa

* Saturated liquid exits the open feedwater heater at 0.7 MPa. 

* The isentropic efficiency of each turbine  stage is 85% and each pump operates isentropically. 

If the net power output of the cycle is 100 MW, determine

* (a) the thermal efficiency  %

* (b) the mass flow rate of steam entering the first turbine stage, in kg/h.

If the mass flow rate of steam entering the first-stage turbine were 150 kg/s 

* (a) what would be the net power, in MW

* (b) the fraction of steam extracted, y?

Engineering Model:

1. Each component in the cycle is analyzed as a steady-state control volume. The control volumes are shown in the accompanying sketch by dashed lines.


2. All processes of the working fluid are internally reversible, except for the expansions through the two turbine stages and mixing in the open feedwater heater.


3. The turbines, pumps, and feedwater heater operate adiabatically.


4. Kinetic and potential energy effects are negligible.


5. Saturated liquid exits the open feedwater heater, and saturated liquid exits the condenser.
