Example 8.6 : Considering a Reheat–Regenerative Cycle with Two Feedwater Heaters, a closed feedwater heater and an
open feedwater heater. 
```
   * Steam enters the first turbine at 8.0 MPa, 480°C and expands to 0.7 MPa. 

   * The steam is reheated to 440°C before entering the second turbine, where it expands to the condenser pressure of 0.008 MPa.

   * Steam is extracted from the first turbine at 2 MPa and fed to the closed feedwater heater. 

   * Feedwater leaves the closed heater at 205°C and 8.0 MPa, and condensate exits as saturated liquid at 2 MPa. 

   * The condensate is trapped into the open feedwater heater. 

   * Steam extracted from the second turbine at 0.3 MPa is also fed into the open feedwater heater, which operates at 0.3 MPa. The stream exiting the open feedwater heater is saturated liquid at 0.3 MPa. 
 
   * The net power output of the cycle is 100 MW. 

   * There is no stray heat transfer from any component to its surroundings. 

   * If the working fluid experiences no irreversibilities as it passes through the turbines, pumps, steam generator, reheater, and condenser, 

* SOLUTION

   * **Known:** A reheat–regenerative vapor power cycle operates with steam as the working fluid. Operating pressures
and temperatures are specified, and the net power output is given.

   * **Find:** Determine the thermal efficiency and the mass flow rate entering the first turbine, in kg/h.

* Engineering Model:

   1. Each component in the cycle is analyzed as a control volume at steady state. The control volumes are
shown on the accompanying sketch by dashed lines.

   2. There is no stray heat transfer from any component to its surroundings.

   3. The working fluid undergoes internally reversible processes as it passes through the turbines, pumps,
steam generator, reheater, and condenser.

   4. The expansion through the trap is a throttling process.

   5. Kinetic and potential energy effects are negligible.

  6. Condensate exits the closed heater as a saturated liquid at 2 MPa. Feedwater exits the open heater as a saturated liquid at 0.3 MPa. Condensate exits the condenser as a saturated liquid.
